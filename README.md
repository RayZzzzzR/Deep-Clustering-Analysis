# Deep Clustering Analysis
**Goal : Discover the natural grouping or structure in unlabeled data without predefined categories.**

Cluster analysis refers to a family of algorithms and tasks rather than one specific algorithm. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem.

Typical cluster models include : 

**Centroid based** : K-Means, K-means++, K-medoids, mini batch K-means

**Density based** : DBSCAN, OPTICS

**Connectivity based** :  Agglomerative (Bottom-up),
 Divisive (Top-down)

**Distribution based** : Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

**Graph based** : Spectral Clustering, Markov Clustering (MCL), Girvan-Newman Algorithm
, Louvain Algorithm

**Deep-Learning based** : Neural Network Clustering, Autoencoder based Clustering, Contrastive learning based Clustering
